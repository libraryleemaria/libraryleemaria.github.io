<b>Maria Lee</b> (she/her) is a recent graduate of the School of Library and Information Science at Simmons University. She also holds a BA in Geography from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.

Maria was drawn to study archives and records management after working in the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights and observing the politics of documentation firsthand. Her graduate studies have sharpened her commitment to information justice and helped her discover her professional interests in digital repositories, research data management, and community-engaged scholarship.
